alias up="cd .."

#
# File searching and editing
#

# Find file(s) by name in this directory (including subdirectories)
# Notes:
#   -This is case-insensitive; for case-sensitive change -iname to -name
#   -Put the file name in quotes, special characters can mess up the search
#   -This only checks the file name, not directory; e.g find . -iname "src" would not return every file in a src folder
# Examples:
#   findf "foobar.cs" (finds all C# files named foobar)
#   findf "*.sh" (* = wildcard; finds all shell script files)
alias findf="find . -iname"
